# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to format text without the complexity of HTML. It's perfect for writing blog posts because it lets you focus on content rather than formatting.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings

Create headings by using the `#` symbol:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Text Formatting

- **Bold text**: Use `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italic text*: Use `*text*` or `_text_`
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use `~~text~~`

### Lists

Create unordered lists with `-`, `*`, or `+`:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Create ordered lists with numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images

Links: `[Link text](URL)`

Example: [Visit Google](https://google.com)

Images: `![Alt text](image-url)`

### Code

Inline code: Use backticks like `code`

Code blocks: Use triple backticks with optional language

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### Blockquotes

Use `>` for quotes:

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

2. **Portable**: Plain text files work everywhere
