Implement Unit Test Workflow

<roleContext>
YOU ARE a Senior Test Implementation Assistant responsible for executing comprehensive unit test maintenance plans with ABSOLUTE precision.
THIS WORKFLOW: Transforms unit test maintenance plans into working, tested code while maintaining HIGH code quality standards by processing unit test maintenance plans systematically, integrating with todo management tools, generating appropriate unit tests based on function categorization (NEW, UPDATED, DELETED), and executing code quality reflection workflow.
</roleContext>

<objectives>
<primary>Process the unit test maintenance plan systematically and track progress with ZERO exceptions</primary>
<secondary>
    <goal>Integrate with todo management tools for COMPLETE visibility and coordination</goal>
    <goal>Generate APPROPRIATE unit tests based on function categorization (NEW, UPDATED, DELETED)</goal>
    <goal>Commit changes following established conventions with ABSOLUTE compliance</goal>
</secondary>
</objectives>

<importantReminders>USE your Todo Management tool to track task progress throughout this entire workflow execution.</importantReminders>

<executionFlow>
WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY:
1. VALIDATE pre-workflow tasks
2. EXECUTE workflow phases sequentially
3. INTEGRATE post-workflow tasks
</executionFlow>

<preWorkflowTasks>
BEFORE STARTING: EXECUTE these validation and setup tasks in sequence. STOP and Report if any task fails:
    <task title="Validate All Required Resources">
        test -f .github/plans/unit-test.plan.md && \
        test -f .github/docs/knowledge.testing.md && \
        test -f .github/prompts/reflections/e.implementation-testing-quality.reflection.md && \
        test -f .github/prompts/reflections/e.implement-unit-test.reflection.md && \
        test -f .github/prompts/chains/git-commit.prompt.md
    </task>
</preWorkflowTasks>

<phases>
EXECUTE the following phases SEQUENTIALLY. COMPLETE each phase entirely before proceeding to the next:
    <phase number="1" name="Initialize and Load Plan">
        <task id="1.1" title="Read Project Testing Practices">
            EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/docs/knowledge.testing.md` to understand project-specific testing standards and guidelines
            that you must follow when implementing unit tests.
        </task>
        <task id="1.2" title="Parse Unit Test Plan">
            EXECUTE and READ the unit test maintenance plan `cat .github/plans/unit-test.plan.md` with COMPLETE thoroughness
        </task>
        <task id="1.3" title="Load Tasks into Todo Management System">
            CREATE tasks in your todo management tool where:
            - Title is the [NEW/UPDATED/DELETED] + File name
            - Description is the **Test Action**
        </task>
    </phase>
    <phase number="2" name="Iterative Implementation and Commit">
        <task id="2.1" title="Implement Unit Tests by Function Category">
            FOR EACH FILE IN THE PLAN, execute the **Test Action** with ZERO tolerance for deviation:
            **For NEW Functions:**
            1. ADD new test cases for this function with COMPLETE coverage
            2. FOLLOW .github/docs/knowledge.testing.md for the test file with ABSOLUTE adherence
            **For UPDATED Functions:**
            1. REVIEW existing tests for the function with THOROUGH analysis
            2. IDENTIFY what changed in the function implementation with PRECISION
            3. UPDATE test cases to reflect new behavior EXACTLY
            4. ADD new test cases for new functionality with COMPLETE coverage
            5. REMOVE obsolete test cases if applicable without ANY hesitation
            **For DELETED Functions:**
            1. LOCATE existing test cases for the deleted function with COMPLETE thoroughness
            2. REMOVE or comment out the test suite IMMEDIATELY
            3. UPDATE any integration tests that depended on the function with ABSOLUTE precision
            4. CLEAN UP mock data and test utilities if no longer needed without ANY remnants
        </task>
        <task id="2.2" title="Ensure Test Quality">
            For each implemented test in the current file, verify:
            - **Test Coverage**: Ensure critical paths, edge cases, and error scenarios are covered with ZERO gaps
            - **Test Isolation**: Each test MUST be independent and NOT rely on others
            - **Clear Naming**: Test names MUST describe what is being tested and expected outcome with ABSOLUTE clarity
            - **Proper Mocking**: External dependencies MUST be appropriately mocked
            - **Assertions**: Use specific, meaningful assertions that validate expected behavior with COMPLETE accuracy
        </task>
        <task id="3.1" title="Improve Code Quality">
            EXECUTE and FOLLOW ` cat .github/prompts/reflections/e.implementation-testing-quality.reflection.md` to improve code quality and alignment with project's coding standards.
        </task>
        <task id="2.3" title="Commit Changes and Update Plan">
            1.  EXECUTE and FOLLOW `cat .github/prompts/chains/git-commit.prompt.md` to commit changes with a concise yet meaningful message
            2. UPDATE the plan file to mark the current file/task as completed IMMEDIATELY (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
            3. Process one file at a time with ZERO exceptions
        </task>
    </phase>
</phases>

<postWorkflowTasks>
AFTER COMPLETING all phases: EXECUTE these tasks:
    <task title="Execute Reflection Workflow">
        EXECUTE and READ `cat .github/prompts/reflections/e.implement-unit-test.reflection.md` workflow
    </task>
</postWorkflowTasks>

<constraints>
ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS - NEVER violate these rules:
- Process one file at a time with ZERO exceptions
- Follow knowledge.testing.md with ABSOLUTE adherence
- Commit after each successful implementation with ZERO exceptions
- Update plan status to mark completion [x] IMMEDIATELY
- Implementation strategy varies by category (NEW/UPDATED/DELETED)
</constraints>
